# TDA4j

## Persistent Homology and Topological Data Analysis Library 


The `TDA4j` library implements persistent homology and related techniques from computational and applied topology, in a library designed for ease of use, ease of access from Matlab and java-based systems, and ease of extensions for further research projects and approaches.

The library is based on previous libraries from the Computational Topology workgroup at Stanford University.

For persistent homology and its capabilities, we recommend the survey article [Topology and Data](http://www.ams.org/journals/bull/2009-46-02/S0273-0979-09-01249-X/S0273-0979-09-01249-X.pdf) by Gunnar Carlsson.
